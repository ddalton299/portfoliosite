                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I have ample customer service experience with customer service being the back bone of my work history.

                <h3>Crossmark: Event Specialist</h3>
                <p>
                    I was an event specialist for the Crossmark corporation. My time at Crossmark consisted of demonstrating products to customers
                    to help them make decisions about purchases. I also kept track of sales made as a result of demonstrations. My time at Crossmark
                    also had a customer service focus. As an event specialist it was my job to assist the customers with anything they might need, or
                    in the event that I could not provide them with the help that they needed, I would find who was capable of assisting them.    

                    <h5>What I learned from my time at Crossmark:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer service skills including conflict resolution.</li>

                <h3>Target: Logistics Specialist</h3>
                <p>
                    I was a logistics specialist for the Target corporation. My time at Target consisted of inventory control, time management, customer service, and education.
                    My time at Crossmark gave me customer service skills that I would use again during my time with Target. I was responsible for helping any customer that required 
                    assistance. Another one of my primary responsibilities was keeping track of inventory in the warehouse portion of the store. I was also responsible
                    for fulfilling customer orders within a deadline which required me to efficiently manage my time. Another one of my major responsibilities was training the new logistics members including managers.
